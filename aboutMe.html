<h2 style="font-size:34px; text-align: center;"> Who am I? </h2>
<pre style="font-size:16px; text-align: center;">My name is Ali Cicek. I
am from North Carolina but I was born in Izmir, Turkey. I enjoy playing 
instruments and making things.
My previous experiences with making robots and objects are using kits that I 
bought off of Amazon. I made a solar powered 
robot, a tin can robot, numerous amouts of toothbrush robots, a drawing 
robot, and a hydraulic arm. I, however, have never made my own 
robot from scratch with my own materials; let's see how well I can make 
things all completely DIY!
