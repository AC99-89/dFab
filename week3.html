<p style="font-size: 18px"> This week, we learned how to work with soldering, drill presses, and saws. In class, we learned various ways to tap using a tapper and how to drill safely and effectively. We also used automatic and manual saws to cut different objects. (This is off topic, but I also managed to saw my own piece of metal using the manual saw!)

<pre style="text-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: royalblue;"> Assignment 1: Creating A Kinetic Sculpture </pre>
<p style="font-size: 18px"> Our assignment was to make a kinetic sculpture; I was so excited, I couldn't even begin to start! I have seen multiple sculptures from artists such as Arthur Ganson and various other artists, but I just couldn't find a design! I ended up with two designs: A simple rotating object, and a flying dragon with flapping wings. I would love to make the dragon so I am going to make it! </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px"> After a talk with Kassia, I decided what to do with my flying dragon design: I will base it slightly off the Sun Earth Moon model. In the Sun Earth Moon model, the sun is a stationary object, the Earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the Earth; I want to mimic this with gears. What I will need to do is print out a post with a gear on the bottom, paste the gear on the bottom of the Earth and get that gear to move a rod around the post (that will be the Sun Earth model and will also be how my dragon flys around). Then, I will have a rod with a gear that moves another gear on a rod; the latter gear will move a rod up and down which will flap the dragon's wings (Sun Earth and a really distorted moon model). Below is the image that Kassia and I prepared for my model.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px"> After another chat with Kassia, I changed the draft of my sculpture; instead of having a rod attach to a post from a few inches away, my sculpture will involve a rack and pinion gear on a main post to help keep balance; my previous model did not have a way to balance so I scrapped it. I also then split the model into two different projects: this weeks project will just having the flying dragon, and next weeks project will have a flapping dragon. I did this I can conseeve time and energy and to not have to do a difficult kinetic sculpture on top of a microcontrolled project. Below is the very bad orthographic projection of the new model. (This orthographic projection has both week 3 and week 4 projects combined; do keep in mind that I still have week 3 and week 4 as separate projects.)</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center"> <b> Step 1: Model the objects </b> </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px">  The first step I decided to take was to model all of the materials I will need to make. I used the Spur gear add-in on Fusion 360 to help aid me in creating the gears. Then I created my two spur gears. Next, I used the GF gear generator add0in to make an internal spur gear as my circular rack. After I modeled the gears, I made the main supporting platform and then brought them all together in an assembly. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center"> <b> Step 2: Cut the pieces </b> </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px">  I then went to the laser cutter and then cut out the pieces, first in cardboard, and then in wood. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center"> <b> Step 3: Assemble! </b> </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px">  I then attached a motor to a heat shrinked wood axle and attached it to my gear. Sadly, it didn't work. Then, I tried to attach the axle with hot glue and tape but that didn't work too. At this point, I completely ran out of time and so my kinetic sculpture sadly failed. I think that if I was able to 3d print a holster for the axle and the motor. below is the video of how my sculpture would have worked. </p>
