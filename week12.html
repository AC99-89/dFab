<p style="font-size: 18px"> <p style="font-size: 18px"> This webpage does NOT include my process of the final project. <br> This week, we only worked on final projects, except me, because I already finished my project. Since this is the only thing we did, there is nothing else to document. I mainly worked on my non-digital-fabrication assignments in my other class and tried helping others' final projects. If you want to see my process for the final project, check it out <a   href=./FinalprojecPROposal.html> with this link. </a></p>
