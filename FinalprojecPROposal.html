<br>
<p style="font-size: 18px"> Before I can design all of the parts, I need to create a list of materials, timeline, and project goals. But you also need to knomw what my final project is. <br> If you have seen my final project ideas website, you know my 3 ideas, out of the 3, I chose the first one (the remote-controlled ant). I decided this because my main goal is to learn how to remotely control two ESP32-Xiaos. For my timeline, I plan on finishing the modeling in 2 days, consrtucting, 3D printing, programming, debugging, and fizing my ant in 4 days, and assembling in one day, giving me enough time to prepare for the final project fair. Here is a list of mats:
<br>
6 servos
<br>
6 3d printed legs
<br>
1 main chassis
<br>
2 ESP32-Xiaos
<br>
Unnumbered amount of wires
<br>
Below is an image of what I expect the final project to look like, along with some details of how it operates and my logic behind the project. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px"> After some more brainstorming, I decided to cut the legs down to 4 and make a quadruped. Not only will this be easier on me, it will also take less 3D printing since many people have started hogging up the 3D printers for their assignments. I was inspired by <a   href=https://www.instructables.com/A-Servo-based-4-legged-Walker/> this person's project </a> and you can see his/her video demo below.
