<p style="font-size: 18px"> This week, we learned how to 3d print. During labs, we also learned how to scan objects using a turntable and a Revo Point Scanner.

<pre style="text-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: royalblue;"> Assignment 1: Design and 3D Print an object </pre>
<p style="font-size: 18px"> I already had a plan for my object since my week 3 kinetic sculpture failed: Create a connector for my motor and my axle. I got my measurements (picture of measurements shown below) and I opened a new Fusion 360 document. I first created a random square in fusion and extruded it by half of my total measurement ((measurement of motor axle + axle + 1 mm) / 2). Afterwards, I made a rectangle using the motor axle measurements and used a fillet of 1.5 mm on the edges and then cut that shape out of my original rectangle. Next, I created a square using the measurements of my axle and cut that object out of my original rectangle as well. Finally, I saved my object as a mesh and begun 3d printing my object. I had to make three iterations before I got a working connector (image shown below). (It took three tries because my measurements were off. The files for my objects are shown below.)</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px"> For the scanning assignment, I took a random part and then spun it on the turntable. I activated the scanner and then used a general scan to obtain the result shown below.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px"> Then, I exported it to Rev studio and filled all of my holes; I finished my scan. </p>
