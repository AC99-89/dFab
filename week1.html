<pre style="font-size: 18px;"> 	We started off this exciting course by creating a website for all 
	the cool things we are going to build. At first, 
I was struggling, I could not find a way to get an html file into my github repository! 
Thankfully, I managed to figure it out and was able to get my welcome page ready. </pre>
<img src=".\2023-06-21.png" alt="Picture of the main web page" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<pre style="font-size: 18px;"> As you can see, the website is very bland. This is because
 I want to keep the website utilitarian for now; I will add decorative features later. </pre>

<pre style="font-size: 18px; "> The images above shows the html
	code for the very web page you are on! The image on the left is th week 1 site code and the image on the right is 
	the main web site code. The week 1 web code is definetly simpler
	cleaner than the main page shown below. The main page is more messy
and includes more content. </pre>
<img src="C:\Users\aliso\Downloads\2023-06-22 (1).png" alt="Picture of code of main web page links" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<pre style="font-size: 18px; "> Finally! I have finished the links and have finished the links and have
completed all of the main requirements for week 1! 
I still have ideas to improve the webpage though, for now, I will list the ideas and get back to them when I
have more time (since these ideas are not necessary for the assignemnt):
- An animated gradient. 
- Return links to the main web page</pre>
