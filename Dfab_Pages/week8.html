<body style="font-size: 36px; text-align: center"> Week 8: CNC, Molding, And Casting  </body>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> This week, we learned how to use the CNC millers as well as molding and casting. All of the files I will use for week 8 can be found in <a   href=https://ac99-89.github.io/dFab/week7.html> Assignment 4 of week 7. </a></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: royalblue;"> Assignment 1: Mill Your CNC File Using The MONOFAB </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> You can find my CNC file in the week 7 website (link on the top of webpage). </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> I decided to skip out on the CNC Shopbot miller so I can continue working on my final project. </p>
 <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;">  My original plan was to 3D print my mold but I later decided to CNC mill it instead since I skipped out on the Shopbot. I got a fresh block of wax and attached it to the sacrificial layer of wax using a hefty amount of double sided tape.  </p>
 <img src=".\IMG_3254 (1) (1) (1) (1).jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Attached Wax." style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> I then loaded my STL file into the machine. The operation was way too complicated so I had Bobby and Ibrahim help me out. I needed to fix the origin onto my wax block so I slowly inched my way to the wax block and jammed the bit constantly. After finding a good origin point, I unscrewed the drill screw to loosen my bit to lay on my wax block surface and calculated the STL file and started the milling. The problem was that the wax block was not sturdy enough and got lifted off the tape so I needed to cancel the mill and put more tape on. I did the same steps but this time the origin was off and the miller was milling too far from the wax block. On the third try, the drill bit got stuck in the miller and when I unscrewed the screw, the bit didn't loosen. Ibrahim eventually had to use pliers to force the bit out and I had to reset my z-axis origin. After fixing the issue, I calculated my STL file and started the milling. </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> The mill went well and so I had a working mold for my cast! After taking my mold out, I cleaned the inside of the miller using a vacuum to make it as squeaky clean as possible (the inside has clearly been dusty for a long time because most dust never even came off the walls). </p>

<p style="text-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: royalblue;"> Assignment 2: Create Something Using Molding And Casting </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> With my mold finished, I started casting. I mixed the hardener with the rubber silicone and poured it into my mold. I poured four oz. of both since the mix ratio was 1:1. I ended up having some extra material left so I decided to have like a little "frozen mammoth" object of my own using a little piece of metal from the shop. I placed the metal in the extra material and let the material cure. Sadly, I had some air bubbles so my cast won't be the best quality but it would still do. After curing for 12 hours, I took out the casts. The cast from the amulet mold went well but the one in the cup is still curing and I accidentally took a huge chunk of the bottom out. My guess is that I didn't mix the silicone properly so it took longer to cure in the cup. Here are the photos of the cast with the mold wrapped in paper towels (to prevent non-cured silicone from sticking on the mold). </p>

<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center;"> Honestly, I had a lot of fun this week; molding and casting was way cooler than I thought. After this semester ends, I will definetly look into doing more casting projects at home (molding is harder because CNC millers are extremely expensive). I really wished we had more time for molding and casting! </p>
