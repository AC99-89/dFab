<p style="font-size: 18px"> This week, we learned how to use stepper motors and various end effectors, however, none of that was important and therefore I didn't learn them. Why? Because the next weeks are only about my final project, which will neither use stepper motors nor end effectors. Instead of listening in lecture, I was working on my final project, which is essentially the sole assignment from now on. Check out my final project process <a   href=./FinalprojecPROposal.html> with this link. </a></p>
