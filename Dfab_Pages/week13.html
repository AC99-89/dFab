<p style="font-size: 18px"> This webpage does NOT show anything about my final project, rather, it is more of a celebratory page of the projects me and my classmates built as well as a thank you for the TA's and the professor. If you want to see my final project process, check it out <a   href=./FinalprojecPROposal.html> with this link. </a></p>

<p style="font-size: 18px"> We have done it! We made it to the end with resilience! Now, we have some fun. <br> The project fair was amazing! I got to meet so many Harvard affiliates and I got to present my projects! I decided to present my weeks 2, 3, 8, and of course, my final project. <br> Thank you to the amazing TA's for getting us through the hard times when our project broke down. Thank you to the professor for teaching us everythig we needed/wanted to know to create amazing machines! Thank you to my classmates for being amazing friends, thank you to the SSP program for letting me take this course to pursue engineering! And most of all, thanks to all of you viewing this website for traversing this with me. This is not the end; it is only the beginning. Enjoy the pictures of the science fair and make sure you check out everyone else's projects!</p>
