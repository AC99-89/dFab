<hr>
<p style="font-size: 24px;"> My three final project ideas so far: <br>
	- An ant that can move around and climb walls <br>
	- An animatronic that can detect when something is taken
	off a pressure plate and react accordingly <br>
	- A self-watering flower pot for my mother <br>
	- A solar battery charger for a laptop that can store energy and charge the laptop. </p>

<p style="text-size: 24px; text-align: center; color: royalblue;"> Assignment 1: Creating A Website </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px;"> 	We started off this exciting course by creating a website for all 
	the cool things we are going to build. At first, 
I was struggling; I could not find a way to get an html file into my github repository! 
Thankfully, I managed to figure it out and was able to get my welcome page ready. </p>
<img src=".\2023-06-21 (2).png" class="img-fluid" alt="Picture of the main web page" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<p style="font-size: 18px;"> As you can see, the website is very bland. This is because
 I want to keep the website utilitarian for now; I will add decorative features later. </p>
 <img src=".\2023-06-21 (1).png" class="img-fluid" alt="Picture of the week 1" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<img src=".\2023-06-21 (3).png" class="img-fluid" alt="Picture of code of main web page" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; "> The images above show the html
	code for the very web page you are on! The image on the left is the week 1 site code and the image on the right is 
	the main web site code. The week 1 web code is definetly
	cleaner than the main page shown below. The main page is more messy
and includes more content. </p>
<img src=".\2023-06-22 (1).png" class="img-fluid" alt="Picture of code of main web page links" style="width: 500px; height: 500 px;">
<p style="font-size: 18px; "> Finally! I have finished the links and have
completed all of the main requirements for week 1! 
I still have ideas to improve the webpage though, for now, I will list the ideas and get back to them when I
have more time (since these ideas are not necessary for the assignemnt):
- An animated gradient. 
- Return links to the main web page</p>
<br>
<p style="color: red; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;"> ***IMPORTANT*** </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: center; "> I learned that github can only access links from relative areas. I am taking an absolute link, that is a link that directly goes to a specific place (from my laptop to the file). Github accesses links relatively, meaning that it finds a specific part of the link that can take it to its place since my webpages are not on the internet (they are on my file, which Github cannot access; instead, I should put a ./ and then the name of the webpage in my links and that seems to work). The same goes for screenshots as well. This will be extremely important as I continue to develop this webpage. </p>
