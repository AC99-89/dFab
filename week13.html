<p style="font-size: 18px"> This webpage does NOT show anything about my final project, rather, it is more of a celebratory page of the projects me and my classmates built as well as a thank you for the TA's and the professor. If you want to see my final project process, check it out <a   href=./FinalprojecPROposal.html> with this link. </a></p>  </p>
